The Orange
桔子

by Wendy Cope
温迪·可普

At lunchtime I bought a huge orange —
午饭时我买来一个特大的桔子

The size of it made us all laugh.
大得令我们全都发笑。

I peeled and shared it with Robert and Dave —
我剥了皮，跟罗伯特和戴维分着吃

They got quarters and I had a half.
他俩各吃四分之一，我吃了一半。

And that orange, it made me so happy,
那个桔子，真是让我开心

As ordinary things often do
就像最近，我时常开心于那些

Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.
平凡的事情。购物。在公园散步。

This is peace and contentment. It’s new.
这便是平静和满足。但很新鲜。

The rest of the day was quite easy.
那天剩下的时光都很惬意。

I did all the jobs on my list
我做完了清单上所有的活计，

And enjoyed them and had some time over.
享受那一切，并打发时间。

I love you. Happy Valentine's Day.
我爱你。情人节快乐。
