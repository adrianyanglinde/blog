The 1th dating anniversary


Always said

I would know where to find love

Always thought

I’d be ready and strong enough

But sometimes

I just felt I could give up

But you came

And you changed my whole world now

I’m somewhere I’ve never been before

Now I see

What love means



It’s so unbelievable

And I don’t wanna let it go

It’s something so beautiful

Flowing down like a waterfall

I feel like you’ve always been

Forever a part of me

And it’s so unbelievable

To finally be in love

Somewhere I never thought I’d be



In commemoration of our 1th dating
